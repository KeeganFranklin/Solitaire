# Solitaire
Solitaire card game clone. This application features a GUI using tools from the JavaFX library. The program is ran from 
SolitaireController, which creates and uses 5 other classes. 3 of these classes, FoundationPile, PlayerDeck, and 
Tableau all implement the GamePile interface. GamePiles interact with each other by passing each other
card ImageViews and Card objects.
